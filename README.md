I did this because I wanted to try out mybinder. Some amazing free service to share interactive notebooks.

Also I really like reinforcement learning but sometimes the amount of math prevents people from making their first steps.
To I'm trying to build something helping people to have as much fun with RL as I have. This is WIP, every feedback (drop me a note or make a pull request) is welcome.
