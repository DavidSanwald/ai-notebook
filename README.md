Began working on this because I wanted to try out mybinder(Some amazing free service to share interactive notebooks).
Visit an interactive executable version of this notebook on:

Now I got ambitious trying to write something which helps people getting into reinforcement learning. I enjoy RL so much but sometimes I feel like the amount of math is preventing people from making their first steps into RL.
My goal is making someone falling in love with RL as much as I am.
